# X-Sequence
## Mathematical Equation

### How To Run

Clone the repository and run `python X-Sequence.py`.

--------------------------------------------------------

Play around with the \( a \), \( b \), and \( m \) values to see how the output changes. Also, see how those changes don't affect the starting step of the loop.

You can also change the `starting_point` value and see how that changes the steps needed for the numbers to enter an infinite loop.

What makes this equation so fascinating is that the number of steps needed to reach a recurring pattern remains the same, regardless of changes to the values of \( a \), \( b \), or \( m \), as long as the initial starting point (\( n \)) remains the same. The changes in \( a \), \( b \), and \( m \) will almost always change the value of \( X \) in the output, but that still doesn't matter; the loop will still begin on the same step because the initial starting point (\( n \)) remains the same.

## Example

Right now the starting point is 7. If you run the code using the default parameters I have, you'll see that the numbers generated in the output are mostly different but all seem to start their loop at the same time (15th step).
