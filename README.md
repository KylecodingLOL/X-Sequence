# X-Sequence
Mathematical Equation

## How To run
Python X-Sequence.py 

Play around with the a, b, and m values to see how the outpout changes. Also see how those changes don't effect the starting step of the loop. 

You can also change the starting_point value and see how that changes the steps needed for the numbers to enter an infinite loop.

What makes this equation so fascinating is that the number of steps needed to reach a recurring pattern remains the same regardless of changes to the values of a, b, or m, as long as the initial starting point (n) remains the same . The changes in a,b and m will also almost always change the value of X in the output but that still doesn't matter, the loop will still begin on the same step because the initial starting point (n) remains the same .

## Example
Right now the starting point is 7. If you run the code using the default paramaters I have, you'll see out the numbers generated in the output are mostly different but all seem to start there loop at the same time (15th step)
