# X-Sequence
Mathematical Equation

## How To run
Python X-Sequence.py 

## play around with the a, b, and m values to see how the outpout changes. Also see how those changes don't effect the starting step of the loop. 

## Example
Right now the starting point is 7. If you run the code using the default paramaters I have, you'll see out the numbers generated in the output are different but all seem to start there loop at the same time (15th step)
